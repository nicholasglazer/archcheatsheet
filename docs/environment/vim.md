# Vim editor
Since  could be your first time editing with vim, here is an example how you can navigate in **command mode**, put some input in **insert mode**:

::: tip TIP: VIM
-   press `esc` to make sure you are in **command mode**
-   `h` `j` `k` `l` for navigating - *left* *down* *up* *right*
-   by pressing `v` you will enter **visual mode** or **visual line mode** by pressing `shift + v`
-   then you can paste it with `p`
-   select what you need to cut and type `dd`
-   to save and exit press `esc` and type `:wq`(*after `:` you will see letters at the very bottom*)
:::

If you don't want to spent time learning this powerfull tool (which I highly recommend), you have several other options including [nano](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nano).

::: tip TIP: NANO
To use nano you should at least know how to *save* and *exit*:

-   ctrl+o - *save*
-   ctrl+x - *exit*
