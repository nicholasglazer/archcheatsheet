** Preparations
*** Live usb
    I assumed that you already have a bootable flash drive.
    If not, check [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disk_cloning][dd]] and the official website for arch [[https://www.archlinux.org/download/][downloading]].
*** BIOS config
    Load the flash drive. \\
    You will need to change the boot priority in BIOS. And just after reboot, press =F2= or =del= to see the BIOS menu.
*** Kernel boot options
    To avoid problems with tiny fonts or fan speed, better to run the new install with the kernel option which will disable console frame buffer.
    To do this, when selection menu appears, press =E=, type =nomodeset= in the very beginning of the line and press =Enter=.
*** Changing layout
    As a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dvorak][dvorak]] keyboard layout user, my first step will be changing keyboard layout:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    loadkeys dvorak
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_attention
    If you use =querty=, skip this step. 
    #+end_attention
*** Network connection
    After archiso has booted you want to make internet connection: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    wifi-menu
    #+END_SRC
    Now lets check the connection:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ping -c 3 google.com
    #+END_SRC
*** UEFI
    Lets make sure we're using [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface][UEFI]] mode:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    efivar -l
    #+END_SRC
    If output has some variables, everything is fine.
*** Partition scheme
    Good. Now lets check [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning][partition]] scheme.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    lsblk
    #+END_SRC
    In most cases you will see at least 2 drives. I have 3 drives:
    #+begin_example
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0 119.2G  0 disk                   *SSD*
    ├─sda1   8:1    0     1G  0 part /boot
    ├─sda2   8:2    0    60G  0 part /
    ├─sda3   8:3    0    30G  0 part 
    └─sda4   8:4    0  28.2G  0 part 
    sdb      8:16   0 931.5G  0 disk                   *HDD*
    ├─sdb1   8:17   0   400G  0 part /home
    ├─sdb2   8:18   0    24G  0 part [SWAP]
    ├─sdb3   8:19   0   300G  0 part 
    └─sdb4   8:20   0 207.5G  0 part 
    sdc      8:32   1   7.5G  0 disk                   *Flash Drive*
    └─sdc1   8:33   1   7.5G  0 part
    #+end_example
**** Partitioning
     If you want clean install you need to wipe your disks:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     gdisk /dev/sdX # where X is your drive name 
     #+END_SRC
     Press =RET= first, then =x= for advanced config and =z= for zap.
     #+begin_warning
     This will destroy data on your disk.
     #+end_warning
     #+begin_tip
     Sometimes you mess up with your ~root~ and want to reinstall the system, but you want to keep your ~/home~ directory untouched. You can do it easily. Wipe only *sda* and do nothing with *sdb*.
     #+end_tip
     And now create a new one:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cgdisk /dev/sdX # where X is your drive name
     #+END_SRC
***** SSD
      I will use *sda* (SSD) as a place for system files, for which speed is critical: bootstraping system, system programs, etc...
      | #    | size      | Fs type | name |
      |------+-----------+---------+------|
      | sda1 | 1g        |    EF00 | boot |
      | sda2 | 60g       |    8300 | root |
      | sda3 | 30g       |    8300 | -    |
      | sda4 | else 28.2 |    0700 | -    |
      - *sda1* Should be exactly ~EF00~. Will boot the system.
      - *sda2* For my ~root~ I'd set 60G, you will be fine with even less. So if you may want to divide space for other distros (e.g. gentoo, ubuntu, fedora, etc..), 30G should be enough.
      - *sda3* This one is for another distro.
      - I'd left *sda4* for Windows. I will make double boot(not included to this guide).
      #+begin_attention
      I decided to make dual boot with Windows 10 for playing games and other weird things like photoshop. And I don't really want to use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine][wine]]. \\
      So in case you want just Arch Linux on your machine, ignore Windows partition steps.
      #+end_attention
***** HHD
      I will use *sdb* (HDD) as a place for user files: configuration, music, projects, ect...
      | #    | size        | FS type | name  | Description                                                   |
      |------+-------------+---------+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
      | sdb1 | 400g        |    8300 | home  | linux filesystem                                              |
      | sdb2 | 24g         |    8200 | swap  | 1.5 of my RAM memory[16G]                                     |
      | sdb3 | 300g        |    0700 | whome | microsoft basic data                                          |
      | sbd4 | else 207.5g |    8300 | -     | Just in case I will mount /var or install another linux there |
      - *sdb1* ~/home~ place for your user files.
      - *sdb2* ~SWAP~ depends on your RAM quantity. Usually you should take 1.5 of your RAM.
      - Notice that I set *sdb3* as 0700 and it will contain Windows files.
      - *sdb4* You may use this space however you want. You can mount it to the ~/usr~ or to the other distro.
*** Assigning file system to drives
    - /boot ::
         Boot need to be Fat32 as UEFI requirement.
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
         #+END_SRC
    - SWAP ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         mkswap /dev/sdb2
         #+END_SRC
    - Linux ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
         mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
         mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb4
         #+END_SRC
    #+begin_tip
    Press =y= if you have this warning: 
    ~/dev/sdxY contains a ext4 file system~
         #+end_tip
    - And reboot ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         reboot
         #+END_SRC
** Installing Arch
    #+begin_warning
    Good idea will be to read [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide][Archwiki installation guide]] first.
    #+end_warning
*** Mounting partitions
    We want to assign ~/mnt~ to the ~root~ partition:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
    #+END_SRC
    Next we need to create some new folders in our ~/mnt~:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mkdir /mnt/boot
    mkdir /mnt/home
    #+END_SRC
    Mount this folders:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
    mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/home
    #+END_SRC
    And enable ~SWAP~:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    swapon /dev/sdb2
    #+END_SRC
*** Mirrorlist
    It's preferable to download data fast, that's why I want to use fastest [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors#List_by_speed][mirrors]]. \\
    Backup first:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
    #+END_SRC
    Uncommenting:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sed -i 's/^#Server/Server/' /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
    #+END_SRC
    Ranking:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_note
    If ranking process took less then (<1min), you should check your internet connection if it's available. This process may take up to 10 min.
    #+end_note
*** Arch base files
    Ok, now lets install base packages to our assigned ~root~.
    In this step you may also want to install some packages, which may be useful while system installing, like [[https://git-scm.com/doc][git]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/][wget]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel git
    #+END_SRC
    Press =RET= and agree with everything.
*** Generate and edit fstab file
    Before we will generate fstab, lets delete the old one:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rm /mnt/etc/fstab
    #+END_SRC
    Now generate the new one:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
    #+END_SRC
    And check if everything is correct:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    nano /mnt/etc/fstab
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_hint
    While this is the first editing with [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nano][nano]]. You should know at least how to save and exit it:
    - ctrl+o (save)
    - ctrl+x (exit)
    #+end_hint
    #+begin_tip
    You also may want to write down your ~root~ UUID. It will be useful later in [[*Bootloader][bootloader]] step.
    #+end_tip
**** Enable [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIM][TRIM]] (for SSD)
     #+begin_attention
     You may want to do this if your ~SWAP~ is on *SSD*.
     #+end_attention
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     nano /mnt/etc/fstab
     #+END_SRC
     Add this line to a file, where ~X~ is your ~SWAP~ partition:
     #+BEGIN_SRC org
     /dev/sdX none swap defaults,discard 0 0 
     #+END_SRC
*** Chroot into the system
    Lets enter the system:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    arch-chroot /mnt
    #+END_SRC
*** Vim
    Next important step will be installing [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/vim][vim]] text editor:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pacman -S vim
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_note
    If you're not familiar with vim and you don't have time to learn this *great* console editor, just skip this step and continue using *nano*.
    #+end_note
*** Locale
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    vim /etc/locale.gen
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_hint
    - press =esc= to make sure you are in *command mode*.
    - for search press =/= and type:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      en_US.UTF-8
      #+END_SRC
    - hit =RET= 
    - =n= for next match till you reach commented one
    - by pressing =i= you can enter insert mode (you can type now)
    - =h= =j= =k= =l= for navigating
    - remove comments =#= with any method you prefer ;)
    - Save and exit:
      - =esc= and type =:wq= (you will see this letters in a very bottom)
    #+end_hint
    And execute this commands one by one:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    locale-gen
    echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    #+END_SRC
*** Localtime
    Replace ~Israel~ with any country you prefer more. You may also want to do =ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/= first, to explore zoneinfo folder.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Israel > /etc/localtime
    #+END_SRC
*** Hardware clock
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    hwclock --systohc -–utc
    #+END_SRC
*** Hostname
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname][Hostname]] is a unique name created to identify a machine on a network. \\
    - Basic method that *working in arch-chroot*. ::
         Replace ~uniquename~ with anything you want:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         echo uniquename > /etc/hostname
         #+END_SRC
    #+begin_hint
    Later you will see something like ~user@uniquename~
    #+end_hint
    #+begin_attention
    You able to generate hostname with ~hostnamectl~ later. But beware this method is *not working in arch-chroot!*.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    hostnamectl set-hostname myhostname
    #+END_SRC
    #+end_attention
*** Add repositories
    Enabling multilib and Arch community repositories. \\
    If you are running a 64bit system then you need to enable the multilib repository.
    To do this open the ~pacman.conf~ file:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    vim /etc/pacman.conf
    #+END_SRC
    Uncomment this:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    #[multilib]
    #Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_tip
    While we are still inside ~pacman.conf~ file, lets also add some useful [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories][unofficial repositories]].

    - You may want to add [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality][infinality]] font libraries.
      Add these lines at the bottom of the file:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      #[infinality-bundle] # Add this if you have i686 architecture.
      #Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/$arch
      #SigLevel = Never
    
      [infinality-bundle-multilib]
      Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/multilib/$arch
      SigLevel = Never
    
      [infinality-bundle-fonts]
      Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/fonts
      SigLevel = Never
      #+END_SRC

    - To have pacman animation add this under the 'Misc options':
      #+BEGIN_SRC org
      ILoveCandy
      #+END_SRC
    #+end_tip
    And update the system. We should [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors#Force_pacman_to_refresh_the_package_lists][let system know about the changes]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pacman -Syyu
    #+END_SRC
*** Passwords
    - Root password ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         passwd
         #+END_SRC
    - User password ::
         We need to add at least one user. \\
         Replace ~username~ with one preffered by you:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power -s /bin/zsh username
         #+END_SRC
         And set password for a new user:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         passwd username
         #+END_SRC
*** Sudoers
    #+begin_warning
    [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sudo#Using_visudo][Impontant to know!]]
    It is imperative that sudoers be free of syntax errors! Any error makes sudo unusable. Always edit it with visudo to prevent errors.
    #+end_warning
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    EDITOR=vim visudo
    #+END_SRC
    And we should uncomment this line:
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
    %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_note
    This system will be only for my own usage. \\
    If you are using server or someone else have access to the wheel group. You may want to require sudoers to type root password, instead of their own. \\
    In this case add this line:
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
    Defaults rootpw
    #+END_SRC
    #+end_note
*** Bootloader
**** Checking EFI
     #+begin_verse
     @gloriouseggroll recommended to double check if our EFI variables had been mounted.
     #+end_verse
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mount -t efivarfs efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
     #+END_SRC
     You will see something like ~efivarfs is already mounted~, this means everything is fine.
**** Boot manager
     So the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot#Standard_root_installations][systemd-boot]] is a replacement for [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB][grub]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     bootctl install
     #+END_SRC
**** Root UUID
     Do you remember I told you to write down your UUID root partition? \\
     If you didn't wrote it, type this:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     blkid -s PARTUUID -o value /dev/sdxY # Where 'x' is the device letter and 'Y' is the partition number.
     #+END_SRC
     ~root~ partition is your goal. In my case I have root assigned to sda2.
**** [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot#Standard_root_installations][Kernel]] ~arch.conf~ file
     Update [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/microcode#systemd-boot][microcode]] to avoid freezes:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacman -S intel-ucode
     #+END_SRC
     Create a conf file:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     vim /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
     #+END_SRC
     And add:
     #+BEGIN_SRC org
     title Arch Linux
     linux /vmlinuz-linux
     initrd /intel-ucode.img
     initrd /initramfs-linux.img
     options root=PARTUUID=write_down_root_UUID_here rw i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 intel_idle.max_cstate=1 i915.enable_execlists=0 acpi_osi= acpi_backlight=native quiet
     #+END_SRC
     #+begin_warning
     The root options is very delicate part, you should double check them for your laptop model. For [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Pro_UX501][Zenbook Pro UX501VM]] I have this options working properly.
     #+end_warning
*** Network
**** Connman
     I'm personally prefer [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Connman][connman]], there are few other options [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/netctl#Installation][netctl]], [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager][NetworkManager]], [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wicd][Wicd]] and even standalone [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-networkd][systemd-networkd]].
     Connman itself a command-line network manager. If you still cannot choose, there are few things [[https://github.com/wavexx/connman-notify#why-connman][why you should use it]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacman -S connman wpa_supplicant # later you may want to install connman_dmenu for ez wifi setup: pacaur -S connman_dmenu 
     #+END_SRC
     Wired connection support is out of the box. \\
     For wifi setup you will need to do few more steps. 
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     connmanctl                       # Should enter connmanctl> shell
     connmanctl> enable wifi          # Lets make sure that wifi is enabled.
     connmanctl> scan wifi            # Scan for any Wi-Fi technologies.
     connmanctl> services             # List of services.
     connmanctl> agent on             # Register the agent to handle user requests.
     #+END_SRC
     You now need to connect to one of the protected services. To do this easily, just use tab completion for the ~wifi_~ service.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     connmanctl> connect wifi_*****   # The agent will then ask you to provide any information the daemon needs to complete the connection.
     connmanctl> quit                 # Exiting
     #+END_SRC
     If the information you provided is correct you should now be connected to the wifi.
     #+begin_attention
     Make sure you disable everything that can be in conflict:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     systemctl --type=service         # to check what services are running
     systemctl disable netctl.service # NetworkManager.service / dhcpcd.service
     #+END_SRC
     #+end_attention
**** Netctl
     I felt some pain with ntectl bugs, trying to configure everything to work properly. And it takes too much time. But just in case you still need/want this one.
     - Checking drivers: ::
          Lets see our drivers, our goal is to find ~Network controller~
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          lspci -k
          ip link
          #+END_SRC
     #+begin_note
     You can check [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration#Check_the_driver_status][more]] commands if you have any problems.
     #+end_note
     - And lets bring the interface up: ::
          It usually starts with ~w~, in my case I have ~wlp3s0~:
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          ip link set wlp3s0 up
          #+END_SRC
     - Installing: ::
           #+BEGIN_SRC sh
           sudo pacman -S wpa_actiond wpa_supplicant dhclient dialog
           #+END_SRC
     #+begin_attention
     - Default DHCP client ::
          I've had issues with connections, and 'dhclient' solved them.
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          sudo vim /etc/netctl/dhcp
          #+END_SRC
          #+BEGIN_SRC org

*** Reboot
    It is necessary to reboot now:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    exit
    umount -R /mnt
    reboot
    #+END_SRC
** Environment
*** Intro
    So in this part you have a lot of different choices depend on your needs. If you are not a strong Linux user,
    better decision will be to use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment][Desktop Environment]] like [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME][GNOME]] instead of just [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment][Window Manager]]. However you still can [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Awesome#With_GNOME][use tiling WM like Awesome with GNOME]].
    #+begin_hint
    For dvorak users! \\
    To change keyboard after reboot:

    setxkbmap dvorak
    #+END_SRC
    #+end_hint
*** Dependencies
    #+begin_attention
    ~--noconfirm~ flag used here. If you're installing packages form AUR and you trust them, you can use this to autoinstall. But you still may want to check build scripts by yourself.
    #+end_attention
    #+begin_note
    Help needed! \\
    This step is not completed yet, more packages should be added.
    #+end_note
    Lets install some important dependencies:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo pacman -S zsh openssh expac termite rfkill unzip tree --noconfirm
    #+END_SRC
**** AUR
     Read more about [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository][Arch User Repository]].
     #+begin_attention
     According to [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers#Comparison_table][AUR helpers comparison table]] you can choose AUR wrapper for your taste.
     #+end_attention
     To install [[https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur][pacaur]] you have to do several steps. \\
     - Install cower first and then pacaur: ::
          Fetch Dave Reisner's key to be able to verify cower:

*** Drivers
**** Video
     #+begin_warning
     Be careful, this part may cause problems. \\
     If you don't know what you are doing, you should *read [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bumblebee#Installing_Bumblebee_with_Intel.2FNVIDIA][bumblebee]] article first!*
     #+end_warning
     Install dependencies:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S bumblebee mesa xf86-video-intel nvidia lib32-virtualgl lib32-nvidia-utils lib32-mesa-libgl
     #+END_SRC

     sudo systemctl enable bumblebeed.service
     #+END_SRC
**** Touchpad
     For touchpad *tap-to-click* use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libinput#Common_options][X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf]] you can also copy it from my [[https://github.com/NicholasGlazer/dotfiles][dotfiles]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S xf86-input-libinput
     #+END_SRC
**** Audio
     [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Installation][ALSA]] is a set of buit-in kernel modules, but after install it may be muted.
     - Install [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio#Installation][pulseaudio]] and utils, and manage it ::
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo pacman -S alsa-lib alsa-utils pulseaudio
       #+END_SRC
     - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Unmute_with_alsamixer][Unmute]] with alsamixer ::

**** Keboard
*****  Keyboard backlight
      [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Prime_UX31A#Using_asus-kbd-backlight_from_AUR][Asus-kbd-backlight]] one of the solutions that solved issues with keyboard backlight.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      pacaur -S asus-kbd-backlight
      #+END_SRC
      - Allow users to change the brightness ::
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo asus-kbd-backlight allowusers
      #+END_SRC
      - And enable services ::
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo systemctl daemon-reload
      sudo systemctl start asus-kbd-backlight.service
      sudo systemctl enable asus-kbd-backlight.service
      #+END_SRC
***** Xmodmap
      If you want to indicate that the current keymap table should be printed on the standard output in the form of expressions that can be fed back to xmodmap.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      xmodmap -pke 
      #+END_SRC
*** X server and friends
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh

    #+END_SRC
    - xinit ::
         If you want to create your own .xinitrc and not using one from [[https://github.com/NicholasGlazer/dotfiles][dotfiles]], do next:
         Check if you have [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit#xinitrc][xinitrc]] file in your user directory:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         cat ~/.xinitrc
         #+END_SRC
         If not you should create or copy it:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         sudo touch ~/. Xinitrc # Or you can just copy it from my dotfiles
         #+END_SRC
         Don't forget to make it executable:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         sudo chmod +x ~/.xinitrc
         #+END_SRC
         To check if everything working properly we can execute command =startx=.
*** Window Manager/Desktop Environment
**** Xmonad
     This is my current Window Manager I'm spending most of time with. \\
     The config is basically the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Haskell][Haskell]] file. So you should know Haskell a little bit to configure it without problems. \\
     For better understanding you may want to read [[http://beginners-guide-to-xmonad.readthedocs.io/index.html][this beginners tutorial]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacaur -S --noconfirm xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar dmenu2 dzen2 stalonetray conky compton
     #+END_SRC
**** Gnome
     Read [[*Intro][intro]] above.
     #+begin_note
     This configurations was not tested by me properly. So if you have any suggestions, you can share your experience, feel free to contribute.
     #+end_note
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S gnome gnome-extra gnome-software
     sudo systemctl enable gdm.service # enable login manager
     reboot
     #+END_SRC
     #+begin_warning
     Gnome use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager][NetworkManager]] which is not compatible with connman, so you should ignore connman step, or disable NetworkManager.
     #+end_warning
**** Awesome
     If you have never used tiling Window Managers before, read this [[https://awesomewm.org/wiki/My_first_awesome#Change_the_theme][beginners guide]] for [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/awesome%0Ahttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/awesome][awesomeWM]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC org
     pacaur -S --noconfirm awesome vicious shifty
     #+END_SRC
   - Themes ::
     This one is pretty good.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone --recursive https://github.com/barwinco/pro /.config/awesome
     #+END_SRC
*** Display Manager
**** Slim (abandoned)
      #+begin_danger
      The SliM project has been abandoned, so it may be dangerous using it without any support.
      #+end_danger
      [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM#Configuration][Slim]] is an option if you decided not to use DE and want to keep everything minimal.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo pacman -S slim
      sudo systemctl enable slim.service
      sudo git clone https://github.com/naglis/slim-minimal.git /usr/share/slim/themes/slim-minimal
      #+END_SRC
      #+begin_note
      - You may want to change this fields in ~/etc/slim.conf~:
        #+BEGIN_SRC org
        default_user        defaultUserItsMeLol
        current_theme       slim-minimal
        #+END_SRC
      - If you have a trouble with logging, you have possibility to enter console from slim, to do this type ~console~ instead of username.
      #+end_note
*** Terminal
    My choice is [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Termite][termite]] this is kind of ~vim~ based terminal, which you can control with a lot of useful vim keybindings. \\
    Also we will need tmux for terminal multiplexing. And w3m browser for images in console.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo pacman -S termite w3m tmux
    #+END_SRC
**** zsh
     [[https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto][Prezto]] looks much lightweight and faster solution than [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]]. //
     Run Zsh first:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     zsh
     #+END_SRC
     Clone prezto repository:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"
     #+END_SRC
     Create a new Zsh configuration by copying the zsh configuration files provided:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
       for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
       ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
     done
     #+END_SRC
     Set Zsh as your default shell and open new window with zsh:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     chsh -s /bin/zsh && exit
     #+END_SRC
     Prezto provides several themes you can choose:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     prompt -l # Check themes list
     prompt -s nicoulaj # To preview a theme
     #+END_SRC
     Load the theme you like in =~/.zpreztorc=
*** Power management
    I will use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP][tlp]] tool for power management, also I will install Intel's [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop][powertop]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo pacman -S tlp powertop
    #+END_SRC
    Enable services for tlp:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo systemctl enable tlp.service
    sudo systemctl enable tlp-sleep.service
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_hint
    If you don't wont to reboot the system, but want immediately start tlp: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    tlp start 
    #+END_SRC
    #+end_hint
    #+begin_note
    Archwiki recommends to disable ~systemd-rfkill.service~ to avoid conflicts.
    #+end_note
*** Fonts
**** Infinality
     The [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality][infinality]] patchset aims to greatly improve font rendering in freetype2 and friends. It adds multiple new capabilities. \\
     If you missed [[*Add repositories][Add repositories]] step, it is necessary to add this lines to your ~/etc/pacman.conf~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     #[infinality-bundle] # Add this if you have i686 architecture.
     #Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/$arch
     
     [infinality-bundle-multilib]
     Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/multilib/$arch
     
     [infinality-bundle-fonts]
     Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/fonts
     #+END_SRC
     Next, import and sign the key:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacman-key -r 962DDE58
     pacman-key --lsign-key 962DDE58
     #+END_SRC
     And don't forget to update pacman:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -Syyu
     #+END_SRC
     #+begin_attention
     - When conflict appears, remove ~freetype2~ and accept ~freetype2-infinality-ultimate~. Same for ~cairo~ and ~fontconfig~.
     - If you have unresolved conflict with ~infinality-bundle-fonts~, I recommend to pick some fonts manually, you will see numbers of all available fonts.
     #+end_attention
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S infinality-bundle-multilib infinality-bundle-fonts
     #+END_SRC
     #+begin_hint
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     xset q                  # You can check your font path with
     fc-list : file          # Show all installed fonts
     fc-cache -vf            # For cache updating
     fc-match --verbose sans # Query current setting, shows info about particular font type.
     #+END_SRC
     #+end_hint
     - More fonts
       #+begin_warning
       A lot of fonts may trash your cache.
       #+end_warning
       You can add more with infinality fonts collection.
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo pacman -Ss infinality-bundle-fonts-extra
       #+END_SRC
     - Picking preset
       Now lets configure fonts:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo fc-presets set # Pick 1) combi preset
       #+END_SRC
       #+begin_hint
       - If something goes wrong or you have problem with Chrome/Firefox fonts rendering, you can pick 4th option to reset
       - When we activated the combi preset, it content could be changed ~/etc/fonts/conf.avail.infinality/combi~.
       #+end_hint
     - Fontconfig parameters
       Configuration can be done per-user through ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf~. You can find it in my [[https://github.com/NicholasGlazer/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/fontconfig][dotfles]].
       #+begin_warning
       Infinality ArchWiki says that ~/etc/fonts/local.conf~ should either not exist, or have no infinality-related configurations in it.
       #+end_warning
*** IDE
**** Emacs
     #+begin_warning
     Be aware of [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality#Emacs][Noto Font]] for emacs. First time I didn't realized that this may cause a troubles. I picked Noto font and I can tell you for sure that spacemacs looks pretty ugly with this font family.
     #+end_warning
    - Install and configure: ::
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo pacman -S emacs
      #+END_SRC
    - I'm using [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#introduction][spacemacs]], installation is pretty simple: ::

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     feh --bg-scale /path/to/image.file
     #+END_SRC
     After this ~.fehbg~ will be created. So you can modify it however you want. As an example how to make random backgrounds:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     feh --randomize --bg-fill ~/.wallpaper/*
    #+END_SRC
**** Notifications
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S dunst

          pacaur -S cava-git
          #+END_SRC
**** Torrent tracker
     If you want rtorrent without vim keybindings, you should install ~pacaur -S rtorrent~.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh

     Choose virtualbox-host-modules-arch for [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VirtualBox][virtualbox]]
     #+end_tip
*** Programming Environment
**** Nodejs
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
     #+END_SRC
***** npm
        To solve [[https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions][EACCES error]]. 
        #+begin_warning
        Option 1 can be dangerous and definitely a bad practice, use [[https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions#option-2-change-npms-default-directory-to-another-directory][second]] instead:
        #+end_warning
        Make a directory for global installations:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        mkdir ~/.npm-global
        #+END_SRC
        Configure npm to use the new directory path:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
        #+END_SRC
        Open or create a =~/.zprofile= and add this line:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
        #+END_SRC
        Update your system variables:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        source ~/.zprofile
        #+END_SRC
        Now you can use ~npm -g~ without sudo, test it with any package:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        npm i -g gulp react react-native tern eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react js-beautify
        #+END_SRC
**** Java
     Install only [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Java][java]] environment without GUI:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk-headless
     #+END_SRC
     Now you need to source from the command line or by logging out/in:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     source /etc/profile
     #+END_SRC
**** Android development
     There are 3 steps that need to be performed before you can develop Android applications on your Arch Linux box:
     - Install the Android SDK core component: ::
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          pacaur -S --noconfirm android-sdk android-sdk-platform-tools android-sdk-build-tools
          #+END_SRC
          Android SDK users group:
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          groupadd sdkusers
          #+END_SRC
          Add your user into this group:
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          gpasswd -a <user> sdkusers
          #+END_SRC
          Change folder's group:
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          chown -R :sdkusers /opt/android-sdk/
          #+END_SRC
          Change permissions so the user that was just added to the group will be able to write in it:
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          chmod -R g+w /opt/android-sdk/ 
          #+END_SRC

     - Install one or [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android#Android_SDK_platform_API][several]] Android SDK PLatform packages: ::
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          pacaur -S --noconfirm android-platform
          #+END_SRC

     - Install one of the IDEs compatible with the Android SDK: ::
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
