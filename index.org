** Preparations
*** Live usb
    I assumed that you already have a bootable flash drive.
    If not, check [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disk_cloning][dd]] and the official website for arch [[https://www.archlinux.org/download/][downloading]].
*** BIOS config
    So the very first step will be to load the flash drive.
    You will need to change the boot priority in BIOS. And just after reboot, press =F2= or =del= to see the BIOS menu.
*** Kernel boot options
    To avoid problems with tiny fonts or fan speed, better to run the new install with the kernel option which will disable console frame buffer.
    To do this, when selection menu appears, press =E=, type =nomodeset= in the very beginning of the line and press =Enter=.
*** Changing layout
    As a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dvorak][dvorak]] keyboard layout user, my first step will be changing keyboard layout:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    loadkeys dvorak
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_attention
    If you use =querty=, skip this step. 
    #+end_attention
*** Network connection
    After archiso has booted you want to make internet connection: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    wifi-menu
    #+END_SRC
    Now lets check the connection:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ping -c 3 google.com
    #+END_SRC
*** UEFI
    Lets make sure we're using [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface][UEFI]] mode:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    efivar -l
    #+END_SRC
    If output has some variables, everything is fine.
*** Partition scheme
    Good. Now lets check [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning][partition]] scheme.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    lsblk
    #+END_SRC
    In most cases you will see at least 2 drives. I have 3 drives:
    #+begin_example
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0 119.2G  0 disk                   *SSD*
    ├─sda1   8:1    0     1G  0 part /boot
    ├─sda2   8:2    0    60G  0 part /
    ├─sda3   8:3    0    30G  0 part 
    └─sda4   8:4    0  28.2G  0 part 
    sdb      8:16   0 931.5G  0 disk                   *HDD*
    ├─sdb1   8:17   0   400G  0 part /home
    ├─sdb2   8:18   0    24G  0 part [SWAP]
    ├─sdb3   8:19   0   300G  0 part 
    └─sdb4   8:20   0 207.5G  0 part 
    sdc      8:32   1   7.5G  0 disk                   *Flash Drive*
    └─sdc1   8:33   1   7.5G  0 part
    #+end_example
**** Partitioning
     First you need to wipe your disks:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     gdisk /dev/sdX # where X is your partition name 
     #+END_SRC
     Press =enter= first, then =x= for advanced config and =z= for zap.
     #+begin_warning
     This may destroy data on your disk.
     #+end_warning

     #+begin_tip
     Sometimes you mess up with your ~root~ and want to reinstall the system, but you want to keep your ~/home~ directory untouched. You can do it easily. Wipe only *sda* and do nothing with *sdb*.
     #+end_tip

     And now create a new one:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cgdisk /dev/sdX # where X is your partition name
     #+END_SRC
***** SSD
      I will use *sda* (SSD) as a place for system files, for which speed is critical: bootstraping system, sysetem programs, etc...
      | #    | size      | Fs type | name |
      |------+-----------+---------+------|
      | sda1 | 1g        |    EF00 | boot |
      | sda2 | 60g       |    8300 | root |
      | sda3 | 30g       |    8300 | -    |
      | sda4 | else 28.2 |    0700 | -    |
      - *sda1* Should be exactly ~EF00~. Will boot the system.
      - *sda2* For my ~root~ I'd set 60G, you will be fine with even less. So if you may want to divide space for other distros (e.g. gentoo, ubuntu, fedora, etc..), 30G should be enough.
      - *sda3* This one is for another distro.
      - I'd left *sda4* for Windows. I will make double boot later(not included to this guide).
      #+begin_attention
      I decided to make dual boot with Windows 10 for playing games and other weird things like photoshop. And I don't really want to use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine][wine]]. \\
      So in case you want just Arch Linux on your machine, ignore Windows partition steps.
      #+end_attention
***** HHD
      I will use *sdb* (HDD) as a place for user files: configuration, music, projects, ect...
      | #    | size        | FS type | name  | Description                                                   |
      |------+-------------+---------+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
      | sdb1 | 400g        |    8300 | home  | linux filesystem                                              |
      | sdb2 | 24g         |    8200 | swap  | 1.5 of my RAM memory[16G]                                     |
      | sdb3 | 300g        |    0700 | whome | microsoft basic data                                          |
      | sbd4 | else 207.5g |    8300 | -     | Just in case I will mount /var or install another linux there |
      - *sdb1* ~/home~ place for your user files.
      - *sdb2* ~SWAP~ depends on your RAM quantity. Usually you should take 1.5 of your RAM.
      - Notice that I set *sdb3* as 0700 and it will contain Windows files.
      - *sdb4* You may use this space however you want. You can mount it to the ~/usr~ or to the other distro.
*** Assigning file system to drives
    - /boot ::
         Boot need to be Fat32 as UEFI requirement.
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
         #+END_SRC
    - SWAP ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         mkswap /dev/sdb2
         #+END_SRC
    - Linux ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
         mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
         mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb4
         #+END_SRC
         #+begin_tip
         Press =y= if you have warnings like this: 
         - /dev/sdxY contains a ext4 file system
         #+end_tip
    - And reboot ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         reboot
         #+END_SRC
** Installing Arch
*** Mounting partitions
     - So the first thing we want to do is to assign ~/mnt~ to the ~root~ partition:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
       #+END_SRC
     - Next we need to create some new folders in our ~/mnt~:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       mkdir /mnt/boot
       mkdir /mnt/home
       #+END_SRC
     - And lets mount this folders:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
       mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/home
       #+END_SRC
     - And enable ~SWAP~:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       swapon /dev/sdb2
       #+END_SRC
*** Mirrorlist
    I prefer to download data fast, thats why I want to use fastest [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors#List_by_speed][mirrors]].
    - Backup first
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
      #+END_SRC
    - Uncommenting
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sed -i 's/^#Server/Server/' /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
      #+END_SRC
    - Ranking
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
      #+END_SRC
      #+begin_note
      If ranking process took less then (<1min), you should check your internet connection if it's available. This process may take up to 10 min.
      #+end_note
*** Arch base files
    Ok, now lets install base packages to our ~root~.
    In this step you may also want to install some packages, which may be useful while system installing, like [[https://git-scm.com/doc][git]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/][wget]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel git
    #+END_SRC
    Press =RET= and agree with everything.
*** Generate and edit fstab file
    Before we will generate fstab, lets delete the old one:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rm /mnt/etc/fstab
    #+END_SRC
    Now generate the new one:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
    #+END_SRC
    And check if everything is correct:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    nano /mnt/etc/fstab
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_hint
    While this is first editing with [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nano][nano]]. You should know at least how to save and exit it:
    - ctrl+o (save)
    - ctrl+x (exit)
    #+end_hint
    #+begin_tip
    You also may want to write down your ~root~ - ~/~ UUID. It will be useful later in [[*Bootloader][bootloader]] step.
    #+end_tip
**** Enable [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIM][TRIM]] (for SSD)
     #+begin_attention
     You may want to do this if your ~SWAP~ is on *SSD*.
     #+end_attention
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     nano /mnt/etc/fstab
     #+END_SRC
     Add this line to a file, where ~X~ is your ~SWAP~ partition:
     #+BEGIN_SRC org
     /dev/sdX none swap defaults,discard 0 0 
     #+END_SRC
*** Chroot into the system
    Lets enter the system:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    arch-chroot /mnt
    #+END_SRC
*** Vim
    Next important step will be installing [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/vim][vim]] text editor:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pacman -S vim
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_note
    If you're not familiar with vim and you don't have time to learn this *great* console editor, just skip this step and continue using *nano*.
    #+end_note
*** Locale
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    vim /etc/locale.gen
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_hint
    - press =esc= to make sure you are in *command mode*.
    - for search press =/= and type:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      en_US.UTF-8
      #+END_SRC
    - hit =RET= 
    - =n= for next match till you reach commented one
    - by pressing =i= you can enter insert mode (you can type now)
    - =h= =j= =k= =l= for navigating
    - remove comments =#= with any method you prefer ;)
    - Save and exit:
      - =esc= and type =:wq= (you will see this letters in a very bottom)
    #+end_hint
    And execute this commands one by one:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    locale-gen
    echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    #+END_SRC
*** Localtime
    Replace ~Israel~ with any country you prefer more. You may also want to do =ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/= first, to explore zoneinfo folder.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Israel > /etc/localtime
    #+END_SRC
*** Hardware clock
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    hwclock --systohc -–utc
    #+END_SRC
*** Hostname
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname][Hostname]] is a unique name created to identify a machine on a network. \\
    Basic method that *working in arch-chroot*. \\
    Replace ~uniquename~ with anything you want:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    echo uniquename > /etc/hostname
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_hint
    Later you will see something like ~user@uniquename~
    #+end_hint
    #+begin_attention
    You able to generate hostname with ~hostnamectl~ later. But beware this method is *not working in arch-chroot!*.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    hostnamectl set-hostname myhostname
    #+END_SRC
    #+end_attention
*** Add repositories
    Enabling multilib and Arch community repositories. \\
    If you are running a 64bit system then you need to enable the multilib repository.
    - To do this open the pacman.conf file:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      vim /etc/pacman.conf
      #+END_SRC
    - Uncomment this:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      #[multilib]
      #Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
      #+END_SRC
      #+begin_tip
      While we are still inside ~pacman.conf~ file, let’s also add the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository][Arch User Repository (AUR)]], so we can easily install packages from AUR.
      Add these lines at the bottom of the file:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      [archlinuxfr]
      Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch
      SigLevel = Never
      #+END_SRC
      Also you may want to add [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality][infinality]] font libraries:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      #[infinality-bundle] # Add this if you have i686 architecture.
      #Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/$arch
      #SigLevel = Never

      [infinality-bundle-multilib]
      Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/multilib/$arch
      SigLevel = Never

      [infinality-bundle-fonts]
      Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/fonts
      SigLevel = Never
      #+END_SRC
      #+end_tip
    - And update the system. We should [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors#Force_pacman_to_refresh_the_package_lists][let to know the system about changes]].
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      pacman -Syyu
      #+END_SRC
*** Passwords
    - Root password ::
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         passwd
         #+END_SRC
    - User password ::
         We need to add at least one user. \\
         Replace ~username~ with one preffered by you:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power -s /bin/zsh username
         #+END_SRC
         And set password for a new user:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         passwd username
         #+END_SRC
*** Sudoers
    #+begin_warning
    [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sudo#Using_visudo][Impontant to know!]]
    It is imperative that sudoers be free of syntax errors! Any error makes sudo unusable. Always edit it with visudo to prevent errors.
    #+end_warning
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    EDITOR=vim visudo
    #+END_SRC
    And we should uncomment this line:
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
    %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
    #+END_SRC
    #+begin_note
    This system will be only for my own usage. \\
    If you are using server or someone else have access to the wheel group. You may want to require sudoers to type root password, instead of their own. \\
    In this case add this line:
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
    Defaults rootpw
    #+END_SRC
    #+end_note
*** Bootloader
**** Checking EFI
     #+begin_verse
     @gloriouseggroll recommended to double check if our EFI variables had been mounted.
     #+end_verse
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mount -t efivarfs efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
     #+END_SRC
     You will see something like ~efivarfs is already mounted~, this means everything is fine.
**** Boot manager
     So the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot#Standard_root_installations][systemd-boot]] is a replacement for [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB][grub]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     bootctl install
     #+END_SRC
**** Root UUID
     Do you remember I told you to write down your UUID of a root partition? \\
     If you didn't wrote it, type this:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     blkid -s PARTUUID -o value /dev/sdxY # Where 'x' is the device letter and 'Y' is the partition number.
     #+END_SRC
     Your goal is ~root~ partition. In my case I have root assigned to sda2.
**** [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot#Standard_root_installations][Kernel]] ~arch.conf~ file
     Update [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/microcode#systemd-boot][microcode]] to avoid freezes:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacman -S intel-ucode
     #+END_SRC
     Lets create a conf file:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     vim /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
     #+END_SRC
     And write down:
     #+BEGIN_SRC org
     title Arch Linux
     linux /vmlinuz-linux
     initrd /intel-ucode.img
     initrd /initramfs-linux.img
     options root=PARTUUID=write_down_root_UUID_here rw i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 intel_idle.max_cstate=1 i915.enable_execlists=0 acpi_osi= acpi_backlight=native quiet
     #+END_SRC
     #+begin_warning
     The root options is very delicate part, you should double check them for your laptop model. For [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Pro_UX501][Zenbook Pro UX501VM]] I have this options working properly.
     #+end_warning
*** Network
**** Connman
     I'm personally prefer [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Connman][connman]], there are few other options [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/netctl#Installation][netctl]], [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager][NetworkManager]], [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wicd][Wicd]] even standalone [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-networkd][systemd-networkd]].
     Connman itself a command-line network manager. If you still cannot choose, there are few things [[https://github.com/wavexx/connman-notify#why-connman][why you should use it]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacman -S connman wpa_supplicant # later you may want to install connman_dmenu for ez wifi setup: yaourt -S connman_dmenu 
     #+END_SRC
     Wired connection support is out of the box. For wifi setup you will need to do few more steps. 
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     connmanctl                       # Should enter connmanctl> shell
     connmanctl> enable wifi          # Lets make sure that wifi is enabled.
     connmanctl> scan wifi            # Scan for any Wi-Fi technologies.
     connmanctl> services             # List of services.
     connmanctl> agent on             # Register the agent to handle user requests.
     #+END_SRC
     You now need to connect to one of the protected services. To do this easily, just use tab completion for the wifi_ service.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     connmanctl> connect wifi_*****   # The agent will then ask you to provide any information the daemon needs to complete the connection.
     connmanctl> quit                 # Exiting
     #+END_SRC
     If the information you provided is correct you should now be connected to the wifi.

     *Note!* Make sure you disable everything that can be in conflict:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     systemctl --type=service         # to check what services are running
     systemctl disable netctl.service # NetworkManager.service / dhcpcd.service
     #+END_SRC

**** Netctl
     I felt some pain with ntectl bugs, trying to configure everything to work properly. And it takes too much time. But just in case you still need/want this one.
     - Checking drivers
       Lets see our drivers, what we are looking for is *Network controller*
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       lspci -k
       ip link
       #+END_SRC
       *Tip* You can check [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration#Check_the_driver_status][more]] commands if you have any problems.
     - And lets bring the interface up:
       It usually starts with ~w~, in my case I have ~wlp3s0~:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       ip link set wlp3s0 up
       #+END_SRC
     - Installing 
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo pacman -S wpa_actiond wpa_supplicant dhclient dialog
       #+END_SRC
     - Default DHCP client
       I've had issues with connections, and 'dhclient' solved them.
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo vim /etc/netctl/dhcp
       #+END_SRC
       #+BEGIN_SRC org
       #!/bin/sh
       DHCPClient='dhclient'
       #+END_SRC
     - Issues
       I had iwlwifi [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=213363][bug]] and [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration#iwlwifi][iwlwifi.conf]] just in case.
*** Reboot
    So now we can reboot:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
    #+END_SRC
** Desktop
*** Intro
    So in this part you have a lot of different choices, depends on your needs. If you are not stong Linux user,
    better decision will be to use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment][DE]] like [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME][GNOME]] instead of just [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment][WM]]. However you still can [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Awesome#With_GNOME][use tiling WM like awesome with GNOME]].

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
setxkbmap dvorak
    #+END_SRC
*** Dependencies
    Lets install some important dependencies:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo pacman -S yaourt zsh openssh termite rfkill unzip tree aspell-en
    #+END_SRC
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    yaourt -S --noconfirm feh emacs htop lm_sensors thefuck connman_dmenu-git xclip
    #+END_SRC
    *Note!* I'm using ~--noconfirm~ flag here. I trust this packages, but you may want to check buld scripts by yourself.
    *Note!* This step is not completed yet, more packages will be added.
*** Drivers
**** Video
     *Note!* Be careful, this part may cause problems if you don't know what you are doing. *Read [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bumblebee#Installing_Bumblebee_with_Intel.2FNVIDIA][bumblebee]] article first!*
     - Install deps
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo pacman -S bumblebee mesa xf86-video-intel nvidia lib32-virtualgl lib32-nvidia-utils lib32-mesa-libgl
       #+END_SRC
       *Tip* Pick ~mesa-libgl~ if conflict.
       *Tip* Pick ~xf86-input-libinput~ if conflict, for the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Pro_UX501#Touch_Pad][touchpad]].
     - Add username to bumblebee group
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       gpasswd -a USER bumblebee
       #+END_SRC
     - Enable bumblebee
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo systemctl enable bumblebeed.service
       #+END_SRC
**** Touchpad
     For touchpad *tap-to-click* use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libinput#Touchpad_tapping][t]]his ~X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf~ you can also copy it from my dotfiles.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S xf86-input-libinput
     #+END_SRC

**** Audio
     [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Installation][ALSA]] is a set of buit-in kernel modules, but after install it may be muted.
     - So lets install [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio#Installation][pulseaudio]] and utils, and manage it:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo pacman -S alsa-lib alsa-utils pulseaudio
       #+END_SRC
     - And now lets [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Unmute_with_alsamixer][unmute with alsamixer]].
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       alsamixer
       #+END_SRC
     - We can test it
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       speaker-test -c 2
       #+END_SRC
**** Keboard backlight
     [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Prime_UX31A#Using_asus-kbd-backlight_from_AUR][Asus-kbd-backlight]] one of the solutions that solved my issue with keyboard backlight.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
yaourt -S asus-kbd-backlight
     #+END_SRC
     To allow users to change the brightness, write:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo asus-kbd-backlight allowusers
     #+END_SRC
     And enable services:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start asus-kbd-backlight.service
sudo systemctl enable asus-kbd-backlight.service
     #+END_SRC

     Next option indicates that the current keymap table should be printed on the standard output in the form of expressions that can be fed back to xmodmap.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
xmodmap -pke 
     #+END_SRC
*** X server and friends
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-server-utils xorg-xbacklight xbindkeys xorg-xinit xorg-xinput xorg-twm xorg-xclock xterm xdotool
    #+END_SRC
**** xinit
     If you want to creato your own .xinitrc and not using one from dotfiles, do next:
     - Check if you have [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit#xinitrc][xinitrc]] file in your user directory.
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       cat ~/.xinitrc
       #+END_SRC
     - If not you should create or copy it:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo touch ~/. Xinitrc # Or you can just copy it from my dotfiles
       #+END_SRC
     - Don't forget to make it executable
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo chmod +x ~/.xinitrc
       #+END_SRC
       To check if everything working properly we can execute command =startx=.
*** Window Manager/Desktop Environment
**** Gnome
     See ~Intro~.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S gnome gnome-extra gnome-software
sudo systemctl enable gdm.service # enable login manager
reboot
     #+END_SRC
     *Note!* This configurations was not tested by me properly. So if you have any suggestions, you can share your experience, feel free to contribute.
     *Note!* Gnome using [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager][NetworkManager]] which is not compatable with connman, so you should ignore connman step, or disable NetworkManager.
     *You've been warned!*
**** Awesome
     If you had never used tiling wm's before, read this [[https://awesomewm.org/wiki/My_first_awesome#Change_the_theme][beginners guide]] for [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/awesome%0Ahttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/awesome][awesome]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC org
yaourt -S --noconfirm awesome vicious shifty
     #+END_SRC
     - Themes
       This one is pretty good, but seems too dark for me, maybe later I will use it.
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       git clone --recursive https://github.com/barwinco/pro /.config/awesome
       #+END_SRC
       This one in my current usage for awesomewm, basically its a bundle of themes, so you can switch between them:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       cd ~/.config/awesome
       git clone --recursive https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats.git
       #+END_SRC
**** Xmonad
     This is my current WM I'm spending most of time with. You can use my ~.xmonad~ configs. Config basically the ~Haskell~ file. So you should know Haskell a bit to configure it without problems.
     For better understanding you may want to read [[http://beginners-guide-to-xmonad.readthedocs.io/index.html][this beginners tutorial]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     yaourt -S --noconfirm xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar dmenu2 dzen2 stalonetray conky compton
     #+END_SRC
*** Display Manager
    - Slim (abandoned)
      *WARNING!* The SliM project has been abandoned, so it may be dangerous using it without any support.
      [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM#Configuration][slim]] is good option if you decided not to use DE and want to keep everything minimal.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo pacman -S slim
      sudo systemctl enable slim.service
      sudo git clone https://github.com/naglis/slim-minimal.git /usr/share/slim/themes/slim-minimal
      #+END_SRC
      Feel free to use my slim.conf file, and modify it.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo vim /etc/slim.conf 
      #+END_SRC

      *Tip!* You may want to change this fieds:
      #+BEGIN_SRC org
      default_user        defaultUserItsMeLol
      current_theme       slim-minimal
      #+END_SRC

      *Tip!* If you have a trouble with system loggin in, you have possibility to enter console from slim, to do this type ~console~ instead of username.
*** Wallpaper
    We already installed [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Feh][feh]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    feh --bg-scale /path/to/image.file
    #+END_SRC
    After this .fehbg will be created. So you can modify it how you want. As an example to make random bgs:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    feh --randomize --bg-fill ~/.wallpaper/*
    #+END_SRC
*** Terminal
    So the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Termite][termite]] is kind of ~vim~ based terminal, which you can control with a lot of useful vim keybindings.
    Also we will need tmux for terminal multiplexing. And w3m for images in console.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo pacman -S termite w3m tmux
    #+END_SRC
**** zsh
     [[https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto][prezto]] looks for me as much lightweight and faster solution than ~oh-my-zsh~.
     - Lets run zsh first
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       zsh
       #+END_SRC
     - Clone prezto repo
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"
       #+END_SRC
     - Create a new Zsh configuration by copying the zsh configuration files provided:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
         for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
         ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
       done
       #+END_SRC
     - Set Zsh as your default shell and open new window with zsh:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       chsh -s /bin/zsh && exit
       #+END_SRC
     - Themes
       Prezto provides several themes you can choose:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       prompt -l # Check themes list
       #+END_SRC
       Lest set the preferred one:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       prompt -s nicoulaj # To preview a theme
       #+END_SRC
       Load the theme you like in =~/.zpreztorc=
*** Power management
    I will use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP][tlp]] tool for power management, also I will install Intel's [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop][powertop]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo pacman -S tlp powertop
    #+END_SRC
    Enable services for tlp:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo systemctl enable tlp.service
    sudo systemctl enable tlp-sleep.service
    #+END_SRC
    *Tip* If you don't wont to reboot the system, but want immediately start tlp: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    tlp start 
    #+END_SRC
    *Note!* Archwiki recommends to disable 'systemd-rfkill.service' to avoid conflicts.
*** Fonts
**** Infinality
     The [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality][infinality]] patchset aims to greatly improve font rendering in freetype2 and friends. It adds multiple new capabilities.
     If you missed ~Add repositories~ step, it is necessary to add this lines to your ~/etc/pacman.conf~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     #[infinality-bundle] # Add this if you have i686 architecture.
     #Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/$arch
     
     [infinality-bundle-multilib]
     Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/multilib/$arch
     
     [infinality-bundle-fonts]
     Server = http://bohoomil.com/repo/fonts
     #+END_SRC
     Next, import and sign the key:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacman-key -r 962DDE58
     pacman-key --lsign-key 962DDE58
     #+END_SRC
     And don't forget to update pacman:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -Syyu
     #+END_SRC
     *Tip* When conflict appears, remove ~freetype2~ and accept ~freetype2-infinality-ultimate~. Same for ~cairo~ and ~fontconfig~.
     *Tip* If you have unresolved conflict with ~infinality-bundle-fonts~, I recommends to pick some fonts you will use manually, you will see numbers of all available fonts.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S infinality-bundle-multilib infinality-bundle-fonts
     #+END_SRC

     *Tip*
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     xset q                  # You can check your font path with
     fc-list : file          # Show all installed fonts
     fc-cache -vf            # For cache updating
     fc-match --verbose sans # To query current setting, also shows you a lot of info about particular font type.
     #+END_SRC
     - More fonts
       *Note!* A lot of fonts may trash your cache.
       You can use extra infinality fonts collection.
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo pacman -Ss infinality-bundle-fonts-extra
       #+END_SRC
     - Picking preset
       Now lets configure fonts:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo fc-presets set # Pick 1) combi preset
       # Only if something goes wrong or you have problem with Chrome/Firefox fonts rendering, you can pick 4th option to reset
       sudo fc-presets set # Pick 4) to reset and then pick 1)
       #+END_SRC

     - Fontconfig parameters
       Configuration can be done per-user through ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf~. You can find it in my dotfles ~.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf~.
       *Tip* When we activated the combi preset, it content could be changed, ~/etc/fonts/conf.avail.infinality/combi~.
       *Note!* Infinality ArchWiki says that ~/etc/fonts/local.conf~ should either not exist, or have no infinality-related configurations in it.
*** IDE
    *Note!* Be aware of [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality#Emacs][Noto Font]]. First time I didn't realized that this may cause a problem, so I picked Noto font and I can tell you that spacemacs looks pretty ugly with this font family.
    - So now I will install my IDE/text editor and configure it a bit:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo pacman -S emacs
      #+END_SRC
    - I'm using [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#introduction][spacemacs]], installation is pretty simple:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
      #+END_SRC
*** Media
**** Browser
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     yaourt -S --noconfirm chromium chromium-pepper-flash
     #+END_SRC
     - Network
       (add more info and test)
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     yaourt -S tor zeronet
       #+END_SRC
**** Notifications
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S dunst
     #+END_SRC 
**** Documents
     Document text reader. Minimal and useful if you like key control.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S zathura
     #+END_SRC
**** IRC
     [[https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration][Freenode FAQ]] explains how to make registration.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S weechat
     #+END_SRC
**** Video
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S ffmpeg vlc
     #+END_SRC
**** Screenshots
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     yaourt -S --noconfirm scrot
     #+END_SRC
**** Audio
     [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cmus][Cmus]] command line music player.
     [[https://github.com/karlstav/cava][Cava]] audio visualizer.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     yaourt -S cmus cava-git
     #+END_SRC
**** Torrent tracker
     You may want to install ~yaourt -S rtorrent~ if you want rtorrent without vim keybindings
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     yaourt -S --noconfirm rtorrent-vi-color
     #+END_SRC
**** Media transfer protocol
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     yaourt -S libmpt simple-mtpfs
     #+END_SRC
**** Virtualbox
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S virtualbox 
     sudo enasystemd-modules-load.service
     sudo vboxreload
     #+END_SRC
     *Tip* Choose virtualbox-host-modules-arch for [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VirtualBox][virtualbox]]
*** Programming Environment
**** Nodejs
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
     #+END_SRC
***** npm
      - Npm sudoers
        To solve [[https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions][EACCES error]]. 
        *WARNING!* Option 1 can be dangerous and definitely a bad practice, use [[https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions#option-2-change-npms-default-directory-to-another-directory][second]] instead:
        1) Make a directory for global installations:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        mkdir ~/.npm-global
        #+END_SRC
        2) Configure npm to use the new directory path:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
        #+END_SRC
        3) Open or create a =~/.zprofile= and add this line:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
        #+END_SRC
        4) Update your system variables:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        source ~/.zprofile
        #+END_SRC
        Now you can use ~npm -g~ without sudo, test it with any package:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        npm i -g gulp react react-native tern eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react js-beautify
        #+END_SRC
**** Java
     [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Java][Archwiki]]
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk-headless # install only java environment without GUI
     #+END_SRC
     Now you need to source from the command line or by logging out/in.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     source /etc/profile
     #+END_SRC
**** Android development
     There are 3 steps that need to be performed before you can develop Android applications on your Arch Linux box:
     - Install the Android SDK core component,
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       yaourt -S --noconfirm android-sdk android-sdk-platform-tools android-sdk-build-tools
       #+END_SRC
       Android SDK users group:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       groupadd sdkusers
       #+END_SRC
       Add your user into this group:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       gpasswd -a <user> sdkusers
       #+END_SRC
       Change folder's group:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       chown -R :sdkusers /opt/android-sdk/
       #+END_SRC
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       chmod -R g+w /opt/android-sdk/ # Change permissions of the folder so the user that was just added to the group will be able to write in it:
       #+END_SRC

     - Install one or [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android#Android_SDK_platform_API][several]] Android SDK PLatform packages: 
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       yaourt -S --noconfirm android-platform
       #+END_SRC

     - Install NDK
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys F7E48EDB # add keyring first for ncurses5-compat-libs
       yaourt -S android-ndk
       #+END_SRC

     - Install one of the IDEs compatible with the Android SDK.
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       yaourt -S android-studio genymotion 
       #+END_SRC
